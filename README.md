- Creating a Verilog simulation of a parking ticket vending machine that accepts Rs 5 and Rs 10 coins and dispenses a Rs 20 ticket involves designing a digital system that manages coin inputs, validates the coin values, calculates the total amount, and dispenses the ticket when the required amount is reached.
- The machine is implemented using principles of Finite State Machine, which hop across different states while keeping track of the input coins.
