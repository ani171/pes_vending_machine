- Creating a Verilog simulation of a parking ticket vending machine that accepts Rs 5 and Rs 10 coins and dispenses a Rs 20 ticket involves designing a digital system that manages coin inputs, validates the coin values, calculates the total amount, and dispenses the ticket when the required amount is reached.
- The machine is implemented using principles of a Finite State Machine, which hops across different states while keeping track of the input coins.

## Tools Used in RTL to GLS flow are:
1. iVerilog:
- A free and open-source Verilog simulation and synthesis tool.
- Part of the Icarus Verilog project.
- Utilized for simulating Verilog hardware description language code.
- It enables testing the design using a test bench, which applies stimulus to verify the functionality.
- Monitors input changes and evaluates corresponding output responses.
2. GTKwave:
- A free and open-source waveform viewer.
- Mainly used for visualizing simulation results produced by digital simulation tools such as Icarus Verilog.
3. Yosys:
- An open-source framework designed for Verilog RTL synthesis.
- Widely employed in digital design for converting high-level digital circuit descriptions into gate-level representations.
- Helps transform behavioral descriptions (e.g., Verilog code) into netlists, offering detailed information about the digital logic through gates and their connections.

## Step 1
- To initiate the flow, the initial step involves creating a Verilog code that encapsulates the idea. This code is saved as a ".v" file. Simultaneously, a testbench is crafted for this file. Both the Verilog code and its corresponding testbench are then loaded into the iVerilog tool. By doing so, the tool can execute the simulation and generate a dump file, allowing us to visualize the waveform.

## RTL Synthesis
- In RTL synthesis:
  - The RTL design is transformed into a gate-level netlist with designer-specified constraints.
  - The design is converted from abstract RTL to logic gates.
  - The logic gates are mapped to technology-dependent gates from libraries.
  - The mapped netlist is optimized while adhering to designer constraints.
= To perform RTL synthesis:
  - Utilize the Yosys tool to generate a netlist.
  - Run the generated netlist using iverilog, along with the ".net" file and the testbench, to create an executable file "a.out."

## Physical Design

Physical design is the essential procedure that converts an abstract depiction of an electronic system, like an integrated circuit or computer chip, into a practical layout fit for manufacturing. This intricate process involves a series of stages for organizing and structuring different components, such as transistors, wiring, and connections, on a semiconductor material.

Key facets of physical design encompass:

1. Floorplanning: Defining the spatial arrangement of components and modules within the chip's layout.
2. Placement: Positioning individual elements like transistors and logic gates efficiently on the semiconductor substrate.
3. Routing: Establishing the interconnections or wiring between these components to facilitate data flow.
4. Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS): Structuring the clock distribution network to ensure precise synchronization throughout the chip.
5. Power Planning: Managing power distribution and consumption to maintain optimal operation and minimize energy usage.
6. Signal Integrity Analysis: Assessing the integrity of signals during transmission to prevent interference or distortion.
7. Timing Analysis: Evaluating the timing of signal propagation to meet performance requirements and minimize delays.
8. Design for Testability (DFT): Incorporating features that simplify testing and fault detection during chip production.
9. Physical Verification: Conducting rigorous checks to confirm that the physical design adheres to design rules and is free from errors.
10. Package Design: Creating the external packaging of the chip, considering factors like heat dissipation and connectivity.
